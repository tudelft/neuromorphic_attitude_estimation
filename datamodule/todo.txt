TODO's for the datamodule:

- Would be nice to include a GUI that makes loading folders easier by:
    - Making it easy to select a folder
    - Shows the entire dataset and lets user decide on what section to skip

- What sigma should be used for GRF encoding? This heavily influences the amount and which neurons spike

- Improve the data_viz functions. Now it is really basic.

- Crazyflie files should be sorted and also transformed
